This is my first post from the blog which i have created using JEKYLL and successfully hosted in `github` page.
Im really happy to host a page like this. Since i was wondering how this damn thing working like a charm.
Really it is super super to work like this. Now i can able to update everything by just copy pasting the damn code
from my system. No need to login into my wordpress and navigate to the posting tab and doing those shits

Happy :)

Now im just tesing the working of highlight

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

i just saw this in the official jekyll post. this is cool buddy. hatsoff to the creator

and the link too working like a julab jamun.....
